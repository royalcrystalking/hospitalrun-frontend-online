Ember front end for HospitalRun
==================================================

Contributions are welcome via pull requests and issues.  This project uses the style guides from Dockyard for [Ember](https://github.com/dockyard/styleguides/blob/master/ember.md) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/dockyard/styleguides/blob/master/javascript.md).  These style guides are enforced via [Ember Suave](https://github.com/dockyard/ember-suave).  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure all tests pass by running ```ember test```.

Help Wanted
==================================================
If you're looking for a way to contribute, the [Help Wanted](https://github.com/HospitalRun/hospitalrun-frontend/labels/Help%20Wanted) tag is the right place to start. Those issues are intended to be bugs / features / enhancements / technologies that have been vetted and we know we want to include in the project.

Needs Requirements
==================================================
[Needs Requirements](https://github.com/HospitalRun/hospitalrun-frontend/labels/Needs%20Requirements) is a tag we use to designate that someone analyst interests / skills can/could/is needed to work out and document the requirements for the given issue. Simple requirements (or frankly anything that can be) should be recorded in the issue. More complicated formatting our documentation could be stored in the project wiki. To be honest, we're working this out still. So if you're interested in helping us sort out requirements, email joel@cure.org

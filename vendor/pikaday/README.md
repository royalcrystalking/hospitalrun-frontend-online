Pikaday - With Time Picker
========

### Forked from [dbushell/Pikaday][david Pika] which only supports selecting dates

This fork allows the user to specify the time along with their date. Done so by adding a couple select inputs to manipulate the date Pikaday is generating.

#### Additional Method:

`picker.setTime(hours, minutes, seconds)`

* Used to set time aspects of date.
* Will not change the currently selected date.
* If no date is selected, will select today. Any of the arguments may be null, and will not affect the date.
